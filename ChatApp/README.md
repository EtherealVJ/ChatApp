Our college Minor Project on java course.

It is just a Minor Project to elaborate how actually a message is send from one user to another server using Swing and Socket Programming in **Java**.

# Files
Here, In Project there are two Folders one is **bin** which is compiled version of **src** which contains source folder and icons.

# Working
Here **src** contains two files *server* and *client* both are two java files one for server which sends message and after that the *client*  receives it.
We have used java.net package and socket class with socket sever,to connect both the servers.
And we have used here swing to create the front end.
